# Simple Interest Calculator

Welcome to the **Simple Interest Calculator** repository! This project was created as part of a micro-finance startup's mission to empower and provide opportunities for low-income individuals. The calculator is a simple script designed to compute interest, laying the foundation for larger financial tools in the future.

This repository is part of a transition from Subversion (SVN) to Git for managing code. It adheres to modern best practices for open-source projects, including proper documentation and community standards.

## About the Project

This project provides a Python script to calculate **Simple Interest** based on the following formula:

```Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100```

Where:
- `P`: Principal amount
- `R`: Rate of interest per annum
- `T`: Time period in years

This is a foundational tool for financial operations and aims to support our micro-finance efforts.
